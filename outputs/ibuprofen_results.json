The \nuse and selection of pharmacologic therapy are controversial because of unclear \nlong-term benefits and the potential of adverse effects. The objective of this \nreview was to explore the safety and efficacy for indomethacin, ibuprofen, and \nacetaminophen for PDA management.\nMETHODS: A chart review was conducted for neonates who received pharmacologic \ntreatment for PDA at our institution between July 1, 2016, and May 30, 2023. \nData collected included treatment success or failure; adverse reactions to the \nmedications, including renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal perforation or \nbleeding, hepatotoxicity, and/or death; and complications, including \nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, surgical closure, and death \nbefore discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 91 neonates met the inclusion criteria. The efficacy rates \nfor the first treatment course were 25 of 31 (80.6%) for indomethacin, 4 of 16 \n(25%) for ibuprofen, and 27 of 44 (61.4%) for acetaminophen. Complications \noccurred in 12 of 31 (38.7%) for indomethacin, 9 of 16 (56.3%) for ibuprofen, \nand 0 of 44 (0%) for acetaminophen.\nCONCLUSION: Indomethacin and acetaminophen had good efficacy, though \nindomethacin had a high incidence of complications. Ibuprofen had lower efficacy \nthan expected (25%) and concerning safety outcomes, which requires further \ninvestigation to see if ethnicity plays a role.\n\nCopyright.

At admission, none of \nthe patients were diagnosed with severe dengue. The patients were divided into \nthree groups: ibuprofen-exposed group (those receiving ibuprofen alone or in \ncombination with acetaminophen), ibuprofen group (patients who received \nibuprofen alone), and acetaminophen group (patients who received acetaminophen \nalone for fever management). Key safety parameters were compared across groups. \nA total of 262 patients participated. The cumulative dose of ibuprofen \nadministered during hospitalization was 0.6 (0.4-0.8) g. No significant \ndifferences were found between ibuprofen-exposed/ibuprofen groups and \nacetaminophen group in terms of platelet reduction, bleeding events, severe \nthrombocytopenia, or the incidence of severe dengue (all p > 0.05). Ibuprofen \ngroup had a significantly shorter fever duration (p = 0.046), while \nacetaminophen group showed a significantly greater elevation in alanine \naminotransferase levels (p = 0.029). All patients were followed up \npost-discharge, and none experienced gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months. \nThis study suggests that safety of low-dose ibuprofen is consistent with \nacetaminophen for fever management in non-severe dengue patients.\n\n© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jmv.70513\nPMID: 40708402 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n3. Acetaminophen.\n\nDrugs and Lactation Database (LactMed®) [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National \nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development; 2006–.\n2025 Jul 15.\n\nAcetaminophen is a good choice for analgesia, and fever reduction in nursing \nmothers. Giving acetaminophen and ibuprofen on a fixed schedule for 24 hours \nafter vaginal delivery appears to increase the breastfeeding rate. There is no \ndifference in breastfeeding initiation rate between ibuprofen or acetaminophen \nalone after vaginal delivery. Amounts in milk are much less than doses usually \ngiven to infants. Adverse effects in breastfed infants appear to be rare.\n\nPMID: 30000253\n\n\n4.

These drugs also act as cofactors in \nallergic reactions. Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), found in plants, represent a \nunique group of allergens in which cofactors play a crucial role. This case \nreport describes a 26-year-old female who developed anaphylactic symptoms after \ningesting grapes and taking ketoprofen. The patient experienced swelling of the \nlips, tongue, and throat, as well as shortness of breath, dizziness, and loss of \nconsciousness, after consuming grapes and taking ketoprofen. She had previously \nused ketoprofen and acetylsalicylic acid without issues but had developed \nurticaria on several occasions after consuming multi-ingredient dishes. Skin \nprick tests showed positive results for peanut and orange allergens. Further \ntesting using the ALEX multiparametric test detected antibodies to several LTP \nallergens. Intradermal tests with ketoprofen yielded a positive result, although \nirritant reactions could not be ruled out. A provocation test with \nacetylsalicylic acid (ASA) showed no adverse reactions. Skin tests with \nibuprofen were negative, and provocation tests confirmed its tolerance. A \ndiagnosis of LTP allergy and selective ketoprofen allergy was made, with the \nrecommendation to avoid ketoprofen and follow a diet excluding foods from the \nLTP group.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26135988\nPMCID: PMC12250210\nPMID: 40649767 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n5.

We aim to develop an algorithm to predict ibuprofen treatment \nfailure (TF) using machine learning (ML) techniques.\nMETHODS: Secondary analysis of a trial of very preterm infants receiving \nintravenous ibuprofen to treat PDA. A predictive model on TF was developed with \nML. The impact of TF on outcomes was analyzed.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-six infants were included. ML techniques showed that \na logistic regression model predicted TF with an AUC 0.65. A multiple regression \nmodel found that bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was associated with TF, \np = 0.03. Other neonatal outcomes did not differ between the study groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to build a predictive model of ibuprofen TF with ML \nthat could assist clinicians during the PDA treatment decision-making process. \nThe identification of responders prior to intervention would mitigate adverse \neffects in non-responders, providing them with an alternative approach.\n\n© 2025.
