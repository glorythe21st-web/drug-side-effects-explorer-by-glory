    "abstract": "A woman in her 80s was admitted with a growing feeling of dizziness, tingling and vomiting that began a week before. The neurological examination showed dysarthria, downbeat nystagmus and gait ataxia. At the time, she was taking antibiotics (1 g amoxicillin and 500 mg metronidazole every 8 hours) following surgery for a mandibular abscess a month earlier.Brain MRI showed T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in dentate nuclei and splenium of the corpus callosum, findings described in metronidazole neurotoxicity. Metronidazole was discontinued, with resolution of all symptoms except lower limb paraesthesias.Given the ageing population and the increasing use of pharmacological treatments for multiple conditions, drug-induced neurological complications are receiving growing attention, yet they often remain underrecognised. Metronidazole neurotoxicity is a rare adverse effect that should be considered especially during prolonged treatments. The most frequent debut resembles this case, with cerebellar dysfunction as the most common central nervous system toxicity and concomitant polyneuropathy frequently associated.",

    "abstract": "In this study, toxic effects of metronidazole (Mtz) on albino mice, a non-target organism, were investigated using organ weight, genotoxicity assays, serum markers, liver and kidney histopathology. Mice were administered three different doses of Mtz (125-500\u00a0mg/kg, 250\u00a0mg/kg and 500\u00a0mg/kg) by oral gavage. The mice in each group were sacrificed at the end of the 14th day, blood and tissue samples were collected. Liver weight increased with Mtz treatment, the highest organ weight was 2.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22\u00a0g in the group treated with 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz and increased by 57.9% compared to the control group. Similary, in the 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz treated group, kidney organ weight was 0.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u00a0g and 37.3% increase was found compared to the control group. Mtz exposure caused statistically significant increases in the micronucleus (MN) frequency and chromosomal abnormalities (CAs), as well as a decrease in cell proliferation. Compared to the control group, mitotic index (MI) decreased by 6.8% in the 125\u00a0mg/kg b.w Mtz group, 16.5% in the 250\u00a0mg/kg Mtz group and 25.6% in the 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz group. Comet assay revealed that Mtz exposure caused significant DNA fragmentation at all three treatment doses. Compared to the control group, the percentage of head DNA decreased by approximately 32% in the 500\u00a0mg/kg b.w Mtz treated group, while the percentage of tail DNA increased by 727%. MI, MN, CAs and Comet test results support each other and confirm the genotoxic effect of Mtz. Changes in serum marker enzymes indicate liver and kidney damage, which is also supported by histopathological examinations. Blood urea nitrogen levels increased by 16.7% and 25.8% in the 250\u00a0mg/kg and 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz groups, respectively. The increase in creatinine levels ranged from 13 to 19.2%. In the 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz-treated group, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were also increased and these increases were 41% and 21.3%, respectively, compared to control. These abnormalities in liver and kidney markers were confirmed by histopathological examinations. Inflammation, glomerular hypertrophy, hyaline casts, crystal deposition, necrosis and tubular dilatation were found in the kidney. In the liver, inflammation, fibrosis, congestion, giant cells, apoptosis, necrosis, binuclear cells and hepatocyte hypertrophy were found. In conclusion, Mtz, which is used in the treatment of bacterial infections, may be toxic to albino mice, which are classified as mammals, such as humans. Consequently, a re-evaluation of the doses and administration times of Mtz, a pharmaceutical agent employed in the treatment of various infections, should be a priority for human health.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the toxicity induced by metronidazole, one of the most preferred pharmaceutical active ingredients worldwide, in Allium cepa L, a non-target organism, was investigated. Many genetic (mitotic index\u2009=\u2009MI, micronucleus\u2009=\u2009MN and chromosomal abnormalities\u2009=\u2009CAs) and biochemical (malondialdehyde\u2009=\u2009MDA, proline, superoxide dismutase\u2009=\u2009SOD, catalase\u2009=\u2009CAT, chlorophyll a and b) parameters have been used as indicators of toxicity. Furthermore, the degree of DNA damage caused by metronidazole was investigated by the Comet assay method. On the other hand, metronidazole toxicity was also supported using the in silico method in a computer environment. Four groups of A. cepa bulbs were created, including three treatments and a control. Metronidazole doses of 125, 250, and 500\u00a0mg/L were used to germinate the onions in the treatment groups, while tap water was used to germinate the onions in the control group. Samples taken from roots and leaves were used in measurements and physiological examinations. Consequently, the maximum MI value and chlorophyll amounts were measured in the control group. In addition, the lowest MN and CAs numbers, MDA and proline levels, and SOD and CAT activities were also measured in this group. Metronidazole exposure caused notable (p\u2009<\u20090.05) declines in MI value and chlorophyll amounts, and notable increases (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in MN and CAs numbers, MDA and proline levels, and SOD and CAT activities, depending on the dose. Metronidazole exposure promoted CAs such as sticky chromosome, bridge, vagrant chromosome, nuclear bud, and binuclear cell in root meristem cells. Comet assay findings revealed significant decreases (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the percentage of head DNA and significant increases (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the percentage of tail DNA depending on the metronidazole dose, and this indicated DNA damage. The in silico study's findings supported the genetic and biochemical toxicity results by showing the direct interaction of metronidazole with DNA, tubulin proteins, topoisomerase enzymes and enzymes responsible for chlorophyll synthesis. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that metronidazole may cause multifaceted toxicity in non-target organisms if it goes beyond its medical use and spreads into the environment. In addition, once more, it has been established that A. cepa is a trustworthy indicator organism for figuring out this toxicity.",
